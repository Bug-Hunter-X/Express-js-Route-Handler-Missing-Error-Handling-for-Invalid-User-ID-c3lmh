# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user inputs.  Specifically, this example showcases a route that retrieves a user by ID, but fails to handle cases where the provided ID is not a valid integer.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches a user based on their ID. However, it directly attempts to parse the ID as an integer without any validation or error handling. If the ID provided in the request parameter is not an integer (e.g., a string, null, or undefined), the `parseInt` function will return `NaN`, leading to an unsuccessful search and a potential crash or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler.  It incorporates checks to validate the ID before parsing and searching for the user.  If the ID is invalid, an appropriate error response is returned to the client.
